## The High-Performance Digital Wellness Guardian for macOS

**SuperZen** is a premium, native macOS utility designed to combat Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and physical fatigue. It acts as a silent guardian, using a sophisticated unified heartbeat engine to enforce the **20-20-20 rule** and maintain physical vitality through intelligent, non-intrusive reminders.

## ✨ Core Experience

SuperZen isn't just a timer; it’s a **context-aware health layer** for your Mac.

### 📡 The Dual-Warning Nudge System

Before a mandatory break begins, SuperZen provides a two-layer warning system to ensure you're never caught off guard:

* **The Satellite (Cursor Nudge):** A sleek, dark-frosted pill that follows your mouse cursor with zero-lag hardware tracking. It keeps the countdown in your peripheral vision without blocking your work.
* **The Reminder Alert:** A rich, data-heavy dialogue box that appears in your chosen screen corner (Top Left, Center, or Right). it provides a "Big Picture" view of your focus streak and offers quick actions like "Start Now" or "Snooze."

### 🛡️ The Full-Screen Shield

When it’s time for a break, SuperZen utilizes the `CGShieldingWindowLevel`—the same level used by the macOS login screen—to create an unavoidable, beautiful atmosphere across all connected monitors.

* **Wallpaper Mode:** Sample your actual desktop with a native Gaussian blur.
* **Custom Mode:** Upload your own high-res imagery for a personalized rest experience.
* **Opaque Gradient Mode:** A total sensory reset using deep, difficulty-reactive mesh gradients.

### 💓 Wellness Pulses

SuperZen periodically flashes high-priority reminders — 0.75 seconds for physical cues, 2 seconds for affirmations:

* **Eye Care:** Reminds you to blink and reset your focal length.
* **Posture:** A physical nudge to sit up straight and relax your shoulders.
* **Hydration:** Tracks your water intake cadence.
* **Affirmations:** A motivational boost to keep your mental state peak.

## 🧠 Automation & Scheduling

* **Focus Schedules:** Define your "Office Hours" (e.g., Mon-Fri, 9-5). SuperZen automatically pauses enforcement outside these windows.
* **Quiet Hours:** Suppress wellness nudges during late-night sessions or early mornings to prevent "notification fatigue."
* **Resumable Cycles:** Choose between a "Hard Reset" after breaks or resuming your focus timer exactly where you left off.

## 📊 Deep Insights (Privacy-First Analytics)

SuperZen v1.1.0 introduces a comprehensive analytics engine. All data is stored locally via SwiftData.

* **Focus Quality Score:** A proprietary 0-100 metric weighted by activity density, break compliance, and interruption frequency.
* **App Usage Tracking:** Identifies which applications dominate your focus blocks. See if Xcode, Slack, or Safari are consuming your productive windows.
* **Goal Forecasting:** Intelligent pacing that tells you when you'll hit your daily focus goal based on current momentum.
* **Trend Analysis:** Compare your current week/month against previous periods to visualize wellness improvements.
